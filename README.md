# ff3-pr-NES_Numbers
A mod that restores the values from the NES version to the best of my ability. This includes growth curves, enemies HP and EXP, Gil rewards and potion prices.

I used the information available in some FAQs for the NES version, and thus I will credit them next:

* Final Fantasy III - Job Evaluation FAQ (NES) by Fantasy_Gamer - https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/nes/563415-final-fantasy-iii/faqs/27853
* Final Fantasy III – Guide and Walkthrough (NES) by Yoichi - https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/nes/563415-final-fantasy-iii/faqs/10205
* Final Fantasy III – Enemy List (NES) by Andrew_Testa - https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/nes/563415-final-fantasy-iii/faqs/72061

I couldn't find numbers for monster Strength, Agility, Stamina and etc, so I kept the default ones from the Pixel Remasters. If someone could provide me those, I would gladly add them to the mod.
